/*!
Welcome to EXPMNT Rust. This library is a collection
of all the programming experiments I've done in Rust.
They're all independent of each other, but I've set up
this library via Cargo and git submodules to make it
easier to manage & view. If you haven't already, clone
everything and run `cargo doc --workspace --no-deps --open`
to view the docs, then select a crate from the sidebar.
